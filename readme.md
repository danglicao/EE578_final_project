Project Title: Numerical Simulation of Half-Wave Dipole Antennas Using 3-D Finite-Difference Time-Domain Solver

If you want to run the code locally, please make sure you have a Nvidia GPU and install the environment in the environment.yml file.

Then you can gitclone the repo and run the code in dipole_with_traditional_gaussian.py

If you don't have a Nvidia GPU, we also provide a 1_ghz_antenna.ipynb. You can run it in Google Colab with their T4 GPU. You can directly run that file without install any environment.
