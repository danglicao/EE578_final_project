Project Title: Using 3D FDTD to repeat the result in 2d FDTD TM mode and add a dipole antenna at center

If you want to run the code locally, please make sure you have a Nvidia GPU and install the environment in the environment.yml file.

Then you can gitclone the repo and run the code in 3d_with_antenna.py

If you don't have a Nvidia GPU, we also provide a 2-4g-hz-freespace-works.ipynb. You can run it in Google Colab with their T4 GPU. You can directly run that file without install any environment.
